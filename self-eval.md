# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
  * Early on in working on this, it certainly got frustrating and I was unproductively struggling. Once I collaborated with other people in my small group, it felt really good and things definitely felt like things clicked for me. It was also very rewarding to write code that works and learn/experience new things on my own.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
  * I have been feeling good about workflow. It has really helped for me to schedule time to do the things that I need to do as it sometimes forces me to take a break.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
  * My small group member Dennis sent me a "Get Ready for Mod 1" guide created by Turing alumni. I plan on working on this over the next few weeks as I have no other commitments really. My dogs are currently away at training, so having to worry less about them will be very helpful as they definitely distracted me at times during Mod 0. My partner is also very supportive and will provide me with most of the support I need during Turing.
